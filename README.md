This project runs as a JAVA application in a computer and will require Microsoft SQL Server Studio to setup the database.
It can work even on a MySQL host but you'll need to add the required MySQL dbs file to the project.
The bookstore.bak file is the backup of Database on Microsoft SQL Server Studio.
